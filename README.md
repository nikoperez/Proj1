# Proj1
A combination of a BFS and DFS algorithm that is able to search through a 2D array, or grid, and find any combination of objects so long as they are neighbors. 
Initally, a BFS seach algorithm is used in order to locate a beginning object, for simplicity, we'll use a word search. The BFS with traverse the grid, given a starting point and then locate the first object, or letter within the grid. Once that letter had been located, a DFS algorithm is them used to find the remaining letters within the word. present the the location of that word, given its cordinates to the user.
